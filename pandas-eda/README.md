## Exploring Language/Nationality Trends of Top Novels

For this assignment, I decided to look for trends in the nationalities of the top authors, as well as the languages in which the novels are written. My goal in this assignment was to uncover any possible discrepancies or biases in the data collection process. I assumed there was, as Goodreads is an American website, so I expected the vast majority of their books to be English. 

If the majority of books were English, it could offer questions regarding how they formulated this dataset and the biases that led them to select mostly English books. This would be true with any language or company. If a Chinese company released their top 500 novels, and 450 of them were originally Chinese, the same questions would need to be asked. 


There is much additional information regarding the results of each visualization in the ipynb file.
