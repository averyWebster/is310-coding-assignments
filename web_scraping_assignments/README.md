## Breaking Bad Wiki Scraping
For this assignment, I decided to scrape the fandom wiki of my favorite TV show, Breaking Bad. I scraped through every episode of the show to find information on who directed and wrote each episode. I also scraped through to find viewership information. The data can all be found at this page: https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Breaking_Bad_Episodes.

#### Robots.txt
Here is the link for the robots.txt page for the website: 
https://breakingbad.fandom.com/robots.txt. THe webpage I scraped is in the "Catogory" section of the website (/wiki/Category), which is not prohibited by the robots.txt.

### Purpose
Breaking Bad is my favorite show. That is why I decided to scrape this Wiki page. Not sure I have any other reason to be honest. 

This information could be useful to many researchers, specifically the heads of studio departments. Breaking Bad is one of the most popular TV shows ever. It currently holds the best rating in TV show history on IMDb with millions of reviews. However, if you were to check viewership statistics for the early seasons, you would see the viewership is drastically lower than what it towards the end. Many great shows are cancelled early because of low viewership, but sometimes a show can take a while to find its audience. Studio AMC decided to stick with Breaking Bad despite its viewership, and it made them a lot of money in the process.

This data also shows information about directors and writers for each episode of Breaking Bad. This could once again be useful for studio heads who are trying to assemble a team of writers/directors for an upcoming project. After all, using production members from Breaking Bad is likely to be a success.
