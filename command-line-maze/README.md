# Command-Line Maze
### By: Avery Webster

### Instructions

1. Use "cd" to navigate through each of the directories in the maze

2. Use "ls" to check the contents of each directory

3. Use "cat" to open up and read all of the .txt files

4. There are many .txt files labeled "clue" or "read_this" for you to read
    
    - Open them if you want, or you can try to complete the maze with no clues at all

5. Once you see a file named solution.txt, open it, as you will have reached the end

6. Have fun!
