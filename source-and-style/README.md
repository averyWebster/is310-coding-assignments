# Source and Style Assignment

Website URL: https://www.baseball-reference.com/

### Languages used:
- HTML is used in the headings and the body for this website. Generally, it seems as if the structure of this website is HTML.
- JavaScript is used for many of the interactive elements in the page, like when you want to click on a person or team.
- CSS is used to link many of the datasets used in this website. These are found in the sources section.
- For every image in this website, they use a JPG file. I believe this is probably because they contain less data than most other image files like PNG.

### Author's and Contributors

All of the authors and contributors for the website are on a specific page in the website. There are quite a few contributors, thousands if you count all who provided data. Baseball-reference takes all possible data regarding the sport baseball. The information on the website dates back to when the sport first started, well over a century ago. Because of that, there are countless sources providing data to be displayed. The founder of this website is Sean Forman. Other people who receive high praise on the sources and contributors page are Jim Furtado, Sean Lahman, Pete Palmer, Doug Drinen, etc.
